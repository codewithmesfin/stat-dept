              In the late 1950s, as the duties and responsibilities of the central government began to
              expand and especially as the Ethiopian government started to prepare a series of five year
              development plans, the need to collect, summarize and analyze empirical data became
              obvious. The shortage of junior (certificate), medium (diploma) and senior (degree) level
              professionals in the field of statistics became more acute. This was also true for the rest
              of the continent. To alleviate this shortage, based on the recommendations of the first
              African Statisticians Conference held in 1959, the UN established “International
              Statistical Training Centers” as regional hubs. The training center for the East African
              Region was opened in 1961 in the Faculty of Science of the former Haile Sellassie I
              University. This center was named “UN International Statistical Training Center”. It used
              to provide a one-year program leading to a certificate for candidates sponsored by
              different governments of the region. It operated from 1961 to 1966, and the Department
              was provided with funding and technical assistance by the UN. During this period the
              enrolment of students from Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Sudan, Malawi, Zambia, Basutoland,
              and Somalia were 52, 24, 6, 34, 10, 4, 3, and 4 respectively.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              In 1966, to alleviate the shortage of medium and high level statisticians, the UN helped in
              the establishment of additional two programs: a three-year diploma program and a four-
              year degree program. The first intake of the degree and diploma programs was the
              freshman class of 1966. Besides the regular program, certificate and diploma programs
              were also introduced in the extension division.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              One of the most interesting features of these programs was their flexibility. Students who
              performed well in the certificate program could continue to the diploma level. The same
              was true for transfer from diploma to degree program. The reverse was also true i.e.,
              students who performed poorly were advised to join a lower level program. In 1973, the
              Statistical Training Center was upgraded to the Department of Statistics and it has been
              running the degree program for regular students and the diploma program for extension
              students since then. In 1974, the certificate program was terminated. In 1975 the diploma
              program was confined to the extension division only.

            <p class="text-justify">
              The Doctoral program in Statistics prepares students for careers in research, applications, and
              teaching. Students choose one of three areas of concentration for their course work:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Biostatistics</li>
              <li>Mathematical Statistics</li>
              <li>Applied Statistics</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <strong>Biostatistics</strong> emphasizes an exposure to various traditional topics as well as recent advances in
              biostatistics and in statistics. It prepares students for methodologic and applied research positions
              in academia and/or for consulting and other positions in industry. The goal is to enhance a
              student's ability to develop new methodologies as well as to address applied questions that arise
              in the medical, agricultural and biological sciences.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <strong>Mathematical Statistics</strong> emphasizes a broad and solid foundation in the techniques and
              underpinnings of mathematical statistics. It emphasizes both breadth and depth of training and is
              intended to produce well-rounded, knowledgeable scholars. This area of concentration is an
              excellent
              preparation
              for
              both
              academic
              positions
              in
              mathematical
              statistics
              and
              industrial/government positions that require broadly trained statisticians with a strong
              understanding of statistical theory.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              <strong>Applied Statistics</strong> emphasizes a high degree of mastery in research design, theory, methodology
              and execution of a broad array of statistical models, such as linear, nonlinear, categorical, spatial,
              correlated response, nonparametric, multivariate, time series, etc. This area of concentration
              prepares students to specify and choose appropriate models; fit models using available statistical
              software; and make sound statistical conclusions and interpretive statements. It also prepares
              students to communicate and present research findings in the related field of application in a
              clear and understandable manner. The students in this category may be required to participate in
              interdisciplinary field coursework related to their application interest such as business
              environmental science, management science, industrial engineering, finance, and other areas.
